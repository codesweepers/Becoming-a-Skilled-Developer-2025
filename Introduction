## Introduction
This repository is a personal roadmap to achieve my goal of becoming a skilled software developer by 2025. Here, Iâ€™ll track my learning progress, showcase projects, and compile useful resources. By sharing my journey, I hope to stay motivated and potentially inspire others who are on a similar path.
